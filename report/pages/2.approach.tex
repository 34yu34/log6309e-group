\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

Explain how you replicated and extended the original paper's approach. A overview figure is preferred to guide your description of the approach. Also don't forget to discuss the characteristics of your data sets and how you prepare/preprocess them before starting your analysis (if any).
You may discuss the difficulties you found and (in case of uncertainty) which decisions you had to take to make things work.

Note: Describe your approach in a concise and unambiguous way: others should be able to repeat your experiments following your report.
Justify your design decisions (e.g., the selection of the models, evaluation metrics, statistical analysis methods). 
You can cite papers like this~\cite{he2016experience}. You can use a different citation format but do keep it consistent.
