\label{sec:comparison-results}

Second most important section of a replication study, in which the results are compared to the original study's results to understand whether the original findings generalize to the new techniques or new data sets, and, if not, why? Go deeper than just "techniques and datasets are different'', i.e., why would that be the case, how do the characteristics of the techniques or the datasets impact the results?
