Present the results of your replication and extension. Compare your results with that in the original paper. You are encouraged to organize your results through answering a few research questions (RQs). You can follow a similar presentation as the original paper. 

Note: Do not simply present your results, but also explain your results and discuss their implications. If you cannot explain a result, then something is probably wrong. Highlight a few take-home messages that you want readers to learn from your results.
